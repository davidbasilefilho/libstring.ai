# String Library for C

A simple and efficient string manipulation library for C, providing common string operations in a clean API.

## Project Overview

This project implements a string library for C that provides common string manipulation functions. The code is organized as follows:

- `string_lib.h` - Header file with function declarations and documentation
- `string_lib.c` - Implementation of the string functions
- `test_string.c` - Test program demonstrating the library's usage
- `Makefile` - Build configuration for compiling the library and tests

Build artifacts are stored in the `bin/` directory:
- `bin/libstring.so` - Shared library
- `bin/libstring.a` - Static library
- `bin/test_string` - Test executable

## Features

- Basic string operations (length, copy, concatenate)
- String comparison and search functions
- Memory-safe implementations with bounds checking
- Available as both static and shared library

## Building the Project

To build the library and test program:

```bash
make
```

This will create both static and shared libraries in the `bin/` directory and compile the test program.

To clean the build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

## Installation

To install the library system-wide:

```bash
sudo make install
```

This will install the library to `/usr/local/lib` and the header to `/usr/local/include`.

## Usage

Include the header in your C files:

```c
#include "string_lib.h"
```

When compiling your program, link against the library:

```bash
gcc -o your_program your_program.c -lstring
```

## Development Notes

This project was **entirely** developed using AI tools - specifically Claude 3.7 Sonnet from Anthropic and Visual Studio Code's Agent edit tool. No manual coding was required at any stage. The AI systems were responsible for:

1. Designing the entire project architecture
2. Implementing all string library functions from scratch
3. Creating the complete Makefile build system
4. Setting up proper library configuration and linking
5. Organizing output files and implementing proper shared library loading
6. Writing this documentation

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of modern AI coding assistants and showcase how far AI has come in software development. This represents the future of coding, where AI can handle complete projects with minimal human guidance, drastically increasing developer productivity and allowing developers to focus on higher-level design decisions rather than implementation details.

This project serves as evidence that AI-assisted development is no longer limited to simple code snippets or minor improvements - it can now handle end-to-end software development tasks for professional-quality code, following best practices and modern standards.
